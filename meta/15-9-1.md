**Sub-indicator a**

The United Kingdom (UK) reported progress against the Aichi biodiversity targets in its [sixth National Report to the Convention on Biological Diversity](https://jncc.gov.uk/our-work/united-kingdom-s-6th-national-report-to-the-convention-on-biological-diversity/) in March 2019.  

The UK is on track to achieve [Aichi Target 2](https://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/) as action is in place across various plans and policies.  The UK has incorporated biodiversity values into a range of planning, accounting and reporting systems including national natural capital asset and ecosystem service accounts, infrastructure development plans, and planning policies at national and local level on land and at sea. The countries of the UK have also established a range of country-based initiatives to support the achievement of Aichi Target 2. In England, the [National Planning Policy Framework](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/810197/NPPF_Feb_2019_revised.pdf) was amended to strengthen the protection for irreplaceable habitats and to make clear developments should provide biodiversity net gain. In Scotland, a [natural capital asset index](https://www.nature.scot/professional-advice/planning-and-development/social-and-economic-benefits-nature/natural-capital-asset-index) has been published annually since 2011, measuring the quality and quantity of habitats according to their potential to deliver ecosystem services now into the future. Wales has introduced the [Well-being of Future Generations Act 2015](https://futuregenerations.wales/about-us/future-generations-act/) which brings biodiversity into the central decision-making process for public sector bodies in Wales.

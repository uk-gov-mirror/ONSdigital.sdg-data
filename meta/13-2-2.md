  <p>Carbon dioxide equivalent units -  In accordance with international reporting and carbon trading protocols, each of these gases are weighted by their global warming potential (GWP), so that total greenhouse gas emissions can be reported on a consistent basis (in carbon dioxide
  equivalent units). The GWP (Global Warming Potential) of a greenhouse gas measures its effectiveness in global warming over 100 years relative to carbon dioxide. The GWPs used are from Working Group 1 of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007.<p>Net CO2 emissions - Total
  carbon dioxide emissions minus carbon dioxide removals.<p>Sector - sectoral definitions and inclusions can be found in Table 12 of the source data (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/final-uk-greenhouse-gas-emissions-national-statistics-1990-to-2018">2018 UK greenhouse gas
  emissions final figures<\a>).<p>Sector (source) - emissions attributed to the sector that emits them directly.<p>Sector (end-user) - emissions by source are reallocated in accordance with where the end-use activity occurred. This reallocation of emissions is based on a modelling process.
  For example, all the carbon dioxide produced by a power station is allocated to the power station when reporting on a source basis. However, when applying the end-user method, these emissions are reallocated to the users of this electricity, such as domestic homes or large industrial
  users. <p>Sector detail - these breakdowns follow the definitions set out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and are used in international reporting tables which are submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) every year. Sectoral
  details, methodologies and sources can be found in Table 13 of the source data (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/final-uk-greenhouse-gas-emissions-national-statistics-1990-to-2018">2018 UK greenhouse gas emissions final figures<\a>).

  Gases are weighted by their global warming potential (GWP), so that total greenhouse gas emissions can be reported on a consistent basis (in carbon dioxide equivalent units). The GWP for each gas is defined as its warming influence relative to that of carbon dioxide. The GWPs used are
  from Working Group 1 of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007.
